# linear-regression-using-gradient-descent
developing a predictable outcome of the given linear data using gradient descent technique
suppose we have marks of students in a class as data and we want to show that more the student studies more thus he scores
so to show this linear relation and predict the outcome of particular degree of that class we design a best fit line which matches the data in the best possible manner.And to achieve the best fit line we find the error for each point by using the formula ![mse_cost_eq1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/29049436/26561733/4a88fc10-44de-11e7-855a-341dfd9fa064.png).
This is also known as the cost function. So what we need to do with this function is that we minimise it to get our best fit line
